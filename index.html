        Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians:

<blockquote><q>It's a brutal field, man. They burn out. It takes its toll. Plus, the lifestyleâ€”partying, drinking, drugs. If you're on the road, it's even more brutal. You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out, and then performing takes you back up. They flame out because it comes and goes. Suddenly they're hot, and then somebody else is hot. Sometimes they get very bitter. Sometimes they just give up. Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again. Sometimes they snap. The pressure kicks in. You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need</q></blockquote>
